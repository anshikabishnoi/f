## What to Look for in a Quality Online Acupuncture Course

Not all online acupuncture courses are created equal. To ensure you receive a high-quality education, consider the following factors when choosing a course:

*   **Instructor Credentials:** Look for courses taught by experienced and qualified acupuncturists who are licensed and have a proven track record in the field. Check their credentials, experience, and teaching style.
