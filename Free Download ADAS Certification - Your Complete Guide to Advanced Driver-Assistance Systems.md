## Why ADAS Certification Matters

**ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems)** is a broad term encompassing a range of technologies designed to enhance driver safety and convenience. These systems use sensors, cameras, and radar to monitor the vehicle's surroundings and provide alerts, warnings, or even take control of the vehicle in certain situations. Examples of ADAS features include:

*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB):** Detects potential collisions and automatically applies the brakes.
*   **Lane Departure Warning (LDW):** Alerts the driver if the vehicle drifts out of its lane.
*   **Lane Keeping Assist (LKA):** Steers the vehicle back into its lane if it drifts out.
*   **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC):** Maintains a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.
*   **Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM):** Alerts the driver to vehicles in their blind spots.
*   **Parking Assist Systems:** Help the driver park the vehicle.
*   **Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR):** Identifies and displays traffic signs to the driver.

**The growing importance of ADAS stems from several factors:**

*   **Increased Safety:** ADAS technologies have been proven to reduce accidents and injuries.
*   **Technological Advancement:** Automotive manufacturers are increasingly incorporating ADAS features into their vehicles.
