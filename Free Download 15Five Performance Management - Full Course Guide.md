## What is 15Five and Why is Performance Management Important?

**15Five** is a performance management platform designed to foster continuous feedback, alignment, and growth within organizations. It goes beyond traditional annual reviews, providing tools for weekly check-ins, objectives and key results (OKRs) tracking, 360-degree feedback, and performance reviews.

**Why is performance management important?** Effective performance management systems lead to:

*   **Increased Employee Engagement:** When employees receive regular feedback and feel valued, they are more engaged and motivated.
*   **Improved Productivity:** Clear goals, consistent feedback, and opportunities for growth help employees perform at their best.
*   **Better Alignment with Business Objectives:** Performance management ensures that individual and team efforts are aligned with the overall strategic goals of the organization.
